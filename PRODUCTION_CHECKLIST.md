## üìã Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-deployment**
   ```bash
   # Review configuration
   cat config/production.env.template
   
   # Update secrets
   oc edit secret nanopore-secrets -n dept-barc
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Apply production configuration
   oc apply -f deployment/openshift/production/nanopore-production.yaml
   
   # Or use minimal resources
   oc apply -f deployment/openshift/production/minimal-resource-deployment.yaml
   ```

3. **Verify**
   ```bash
   # Check deployment status
   oc rollout status deployment/nanopore-app -n dept-barc
   
   # Check pods
   oc get pods -l app=nanopore-tracking -n dept-barc
   
   # Check logs
   oc logs -l app=nanopore-tracking -n dept-barc
   ```

4. **Test**
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl https://nanopore-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/health
   
   # Basic functionality
   curl https://nanopore-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/api/health
   ```

## üî• Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Quick Rollback**
   ```bash
   oc rollout undo deployment/nanopore-app -n dept-barc
   ```

2. **Full Rollback**
   ```bash
   oc delete -f deployment/openshift/production/nanopore-production.yaml
   oc apply -f deployment/openshift/production/previous-version.yaml
   ```
