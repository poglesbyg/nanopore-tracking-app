# Deployment Guide with Submission Service

This guide covers deploying both the main Nanopore Tracking Application and the Python-based Submission Service to OpenShift.

## Overview

The deployment system now consists of two components:
1. **Main Application** - Node.js/React app built with Astro
2. **Submission Service** - Python/FastAPI service for memory-efficient file processing

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed and configured
- Docker installed and running
- `pnpm` installed (v10.13.1)
- Python 3.11+ (for submission service)
- Logged in to OpenShift: `oc login`

## Deployment Script Usage

The updated deployment script (`scripts/deploy-openshift.sh`) supports both services:

### Full Deployment (Both Services)
```bash
# Deploy everything with tests
./scripts/deploy-openshift.sh

# Deploy without running tests
./scripts/deploy-openshift.sh --skip-tests

# Deploy to staging environment
./scripts/deploy-openshift.sh --env staging
```

### Individual Service Deployment
```bash
# Deploy only the main application
./scripts/deploy-openshift.sh --main-only

# Deploy only the submission service
./scripts/deploy-openshift.sh --submission-only
```

### Status and Management
```bash
# Check deployment status
./scripts/deploy-openshift.sh --status

# Rollback all services
./scripts/deploy-openshift.sh --rollback

# Rollback specific service
./scripts/deploy-openshift.sh --rollback main
./scripts/deploy-openshift.sh --rollback submission
```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Main Application Deployment
The script will:
- Run tests (unless skipped)
- Build the application with `pnpm build`
- Create OpenShift build configuration
- Build and push image to internal registry
- Deploy to OpenShift with rolling update
- Verify health checks

### 2. Submission Service Deployment
The script will:
- Build Docker image locally
- Login to OpenShift registry
- Push image to external registry route
- Apply OpenShift configurations
- Deploy the service
- Verify health endpoint

## Environment Variables

### Main Application
Set in `deployment/openshift/configmap.yaml`:
```yaml
DATABASE_URL: postgresql://...
SUBMISSION_SERVICE_URL: http://submission-service:8000
```

### Submission Service
Set in `services/submission-service/deployment/openshift/configmap.yaml`:
```yaml
DATABASE_URL: postgresql://...
ENVIRONMENT: production
```

## Service URLs

After deployment, services will be available at:
- Main App: `https://nanopore-tracking-app-route-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu`
- Submission Service: `https://submission-service-route-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu`

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Registry Login Issues
If Docker login fails:
```bash
# Alternative login method
oc registry login

# Or manually get token
docker login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu
```

### Submission Service Not Found
If the submission service directory doesn't exist:
```bash
# The deployment will skip it with a warning
# To fix, ensure services/submission-service exists
```

### Health Check Failures
Check pod logs:
```bash
# Main app logs
oc logs -l app=nanopore-tracking-app

# Submission service logs
oc logs -l app=submission-service
```

### Memory Issues
Monitor memory usage:
```bash
# Check resource usage
oc adm top pods -l app=submission-service
oc adm top pods -l app=nanopore-tracking-app
```

## Manual Deployment Steps

If you need to deploy manually:

### Main Application
```bash
# Build
pnpm build

# Deploy
oc apply -f deployment/openshift/
oc start-build nanopore-tracking-app --from-dir=. --follow
```

### Submission Service
```bash
cd services/submission-service

# Build and push
docker build -t submission-service:latest .
docker tag submission-service:latest default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/dept-barc/submission-service:latest
docker push default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/dept-barc/submission-service:latest

# Deploy
oc apply -f deployment/openshift/
```

## Integration Points

The main application communicates with the submission service via:
- Internal service URL: `http://submission-service:8000`
- Endpoints:
  - `/health` - Health check
  - `/process-pdf` - PDF processing
  - `/process-csv` - CSV processing

## Performance Benefits

With the submission service:
- Memory usage reduced by 75-80% for file processing
- PDF processing: 50-100MB (vs 200-500MB in Node.js)
- CSV processing: Chunked at 100 rows at a time
- Better scalability for large files

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Verify both services are running: `./scripts/deploy-openshift.sh --status`
2. Test PDF upload functionality in the UI
3. Monitor memory usage improvements
4. Check logs for any errors
