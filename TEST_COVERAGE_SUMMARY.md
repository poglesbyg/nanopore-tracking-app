## 📝 Test Implementation Status

- ✅ Core functionality tested
- ✅ Critical user paths covered
- ⚠️ Some integration tests failing
- ❌ Advanced features not tested
- ❌ Error scenarios partially tested

The application has good test coverage for core features, especially with the new project/submission hierarchy functionality. However, there are gaps in testing error scenarios, edge cases, and advanced features.
