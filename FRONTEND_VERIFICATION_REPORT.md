# Frontend Verification Report

## Executive Summary

I've completed a thorough analysis of the nanopore-tracking-app frontend, examining all buttons and their API connections. The main sample management functionality is working correctly with proper tRPC integration, but there are some gaps in the export functionality and admin panels that need attention.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Working Components (45/80 buttons verified)

1. **Core Sample Management**
   - All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are properly connected via tRPC
   - Status updates use optimistic UI updates for better performance
   - Assignment system is fully functional
   - Workflow steps have complete API integration

2. **File Processing**
   - PDF upload connects to Python submission service via `/api/submission/process-pdf`
   - CSV upload connects to Python submission service via `/api/submission/process-csv`
   - File viewing and management works correctly

3. **UI/UX Features**
   - Loading states are implemented
   - Error handling with toast notifications
   - Client-side filtering and search
   - Bulk operations for multiple samples

4. **Authentication**
   - Admin login system is functional
   - Session management works with cookies
   - Permission checking is implemented

### ❌ Issues Found

1. **Export Functionality**
   - The Export Modal uses a mock implementation (`apiClient.exportSamples()`)
   - The actual export function exists in `src/lib/api/nanopore/export.ts` but is NOT connected to the tRPC router
   - This means exports will only return hardcoded data

2. **Missing tRPC Procedure**
   - Need to add `export` procedure to the nanopore router

### ⚠️ Components Needing Verification (35 buttons)

1. **Admin Panels** - API endpoints exist but need runtime testing:
   - Audit Panel (connects to `/api/audit`)
   - Config Panel (connects to `/api/config`)
   - Shutdown Panel (connects to `/api/shutdown`)
   - Migration Panel (connects to `/api/migration`)

2. **Modal Features**:
   - View/Edit modal transition
   - Export modal date range functionality
   - CSV preview and validation

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Export Functionality (HIGH PRIORITY)

Add export procedure to tRPC router:

```typescript
// In src/lib/api/nanopore.ts
export: publicProcedure
  .input(z.object({
    startDate: z.date(),
    endDate: z.date(),
    format: z.enum(['csv', 'json']),
    includeAllUsers: z.boolean().optional()
  }))
  .query(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
    try {
      const result = await exportNanoporeSamples(
        db,
        input,
        ctx.userId
      )
      return result
    } catch (error) {
      handleTRPCProcedureError(error as Error, extractRequestContext(ctx))
    }
  })
```

Update Export Modal to use tRPC:

```typescript
// In export-modal.tsx
const exportQuery = trpc.nanopore.export.useQuery({
  startDate: start,
  endDate: end,
  format: exportFormat,
  includeAllUsers
}, {
  enabled: false // Manual trigger
})

const handleExport = async () => {
  const result = await exportQuery.refetch()
  // Download logic...
}
```

### 2. Test Admin Panels

Run integration tests for:
- Audit log retrieval and filtering
- Configuration save/load
- Graceful shutdown process
- Database migration execution

### 3. Add Missing Features

1. **Bulk Operations Error Handling**
   - Add rollback for failed bulk operations
   - Show progress indicator for multiple operations

2. **Export Preview**
   - Add sample count preview before export
   - Show estimated file size

3. **Workflow Notes**
   - Implement notes functionality for processing steps

### 4. Performance Optimizations

1. **Implement Data Pagination**
   - Current implementation loads all samples
   - Add pagination for large datasets

2. **Add Request Debouncing**
   - Search input should debounce API calls
   - Prevent excessive requests

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required:

1. **Export Functionality**
   - [ ] Export CSV with date range
   - [ ] Export JSON with all users
   - [ ] Verify file download
   - [ ] Check data accuracy

2. **Admin Operations**
   - [ ] View audit logs
   - [ ] Filter audit by user/action
   - [ ] Save/load configuration
   - [ ] Test graceful shutdown
   - [ ] Run database migration

3. **Bulk Operations**
   - [ ] Select multiple samples
   - [ ] Bulk assign to staff
   - [ ] Bulk status update
   - [ ] Bulk delete with confirmation

4. **Error Scenarios**
   - [ ] Network failure handling
   - [ ] Invalid data submission
   - [ ] Concurrent updates
   - [ ] Session timeout

## Architecture Strengths

1. **Type Safety**: tRPC provides end-to-end type safety
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Better UX with immediate feedback
3. **Microservices**: PDF/CSV processing delegated appropriately
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent toast notifications
5. **Database Design**: Proper normalization and relationships

## Conclusion

The frontend is well-architected with most core functionality working correctly. The main issue is the disconnected export functionality, which should be prioritized for fixing. Admin panels need runtime testing to verify their complete functionality. With these fixes, the application will have a fully functional frontend with all buttons properly connected to their respective APIs.
