# HTSF PDF Test Results

## Test File: HTSF--JL-147_quote_160217072025.pdf

This is a real HTSF (High-Throughput Sequencing Facility) PDF quote form with 43 samples.

## Extraction Results

### Successfully Extracted:
✅ **Basic Information**
- Submitter Email: `joshleon@unc.edu`
- Submitter Name: `Joshua Leon`
- Organism: `Fungi from plant leave tissue`
- Sample Type: `High Molecular Weight DNA / gDNA`
- Buffer: `EB`
- Quote ID: `HTSF--JL-147`
- Lab: `Mitchell, Charles (UNC-CH) Lab`

✅ **Sample Table**
- Extracted all 43 samples from the table
- Each sample includes:
  - Sample name (1-43)
  - Volume (µL)
  - Qubit concentration
  - Nanodrop concentration
  - A260/A280 ratio
  - A260/A230 ratio

✅ **Service Details**
- Service Type: `Oxford Nanopore DNA Samples Request`
- Sequencing Type: `Ligation Sequencing (SQK-LSK114)`
- Basecalling: `HAC (High Accuracy)`
- File Format: `FASTQ / BAM`
- Coverage: `50x-100x`
- Genome Size: `600 Mb`

✅ **Metadata**
- PI: `Charles Mitchell`
- PI Email: `mitchell@bio.unc.edu`

### Issues to Fix:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Some fields capture extra text
   - Example: `sample_name` captured table header instead of actual sample names
   - Some fields have trailing text that shouldn't be included

2. **Field Mapping**: The sample table data structure works but individual sample names from the main form aren't captured correctly

3. **Concentration/Volume**: The individual sample concentration and volume aren't extracted from the main form (though they are in the table)

## How to Test

### Via Web UI:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/submit-pdf
2. Upload `HTSF--JL-147_quote_160217072025.pdf`
3. You'll see the extracted data displayed

### Via API:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@HTSF--JL-147_quote_160217072025.pdf" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/submission/process-pdf | jq
```

### Via Python Script:
```bash
cd services/submission-service
source .test_venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. python ../../test_real_htsf_pdf.py
```

## Summary

The PDF extraction is **working** and successfully extracts most of the important data from real HTSF PDFs, including complex sample tables. The main issues are minor pattern matching improvements that would make the extraction cleaner, but the core functionality is solid.

For production use, consider:
1. Improving regex patterns to better match HTSF form fields
2. Adding AI enhancement for better field extraction
3. Creating sample-specific extraction for multi-sample PDFs
4. Adding validation for extracted data

The system can handle real HTSF PDFs and extract the data needed for sample tracking!
