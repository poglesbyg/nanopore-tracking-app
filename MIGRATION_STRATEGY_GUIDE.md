# Python Microservices Migration Strategy Guide

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic approach for migrating the Nanopore Tracking Application from a monolithic architecture to Python microservices. The migration has been successfully implemented locally and is ready for production deployment.

## Current Architecture Assessment

### Monolithic Architecture (Current Production)

- **Scalability**: Entire application scales as one unit
- **Maintenance**: Single codebase, shared database

### Python Microservices Architecture (Ready for Migration)
- **Technology Stack**: 6 FastAPI services, PostgreSQL per service, unified API Gateway
- **Deployment**: Individual containerized services with auto-scaling
