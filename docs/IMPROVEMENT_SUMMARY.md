# Nanopore Tracking App - Improvement Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvement plan for the nanopore tracking application, focusing on making it more modular, professional, and scalable.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Frontend Modularization

**Problem**: The main dashboard component (`nanopore-dashboard.tsx`) is 2019 lines long with mixed concerns.

**Solution**:
- Break down into feature-based modules
- Implement proper state management with Zustand
- Extract reusable components and custom hooks
- Separate business logic from UI components

**Benefits**:
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Better code reusability
- Improved developer experience
- Faster feature development

### 2. Backend Service Standardization

**Problem**: Inconsistent service architecture between TypeScript and Python services.

**Solution**:
- Implement clean architecture principles
- Standardize repository pattern
- Add dependency injection
- Create event-driven communication

**Benefits**:
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing and mocking
- Improved scalability
- Consistent patterns across services

### 3. MCP Integration

**Problem**: Limited AI capabilities and domain-specific intelligence.

**Solution**:
- Create specialized MCP servers for:
  - Domain expertise (validation, recommendations)
  - Workflow automation
  - Data analysis
  - Document intelligence

**Benefits**:
- Enhanced automation capabilities
- Better decision support
- Reduced manual work
- Scalable AI integration
