# Nanopore Tracking App - Refactoring Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to refactoring the nanopore tracking application to improve modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

## Phase 1: Frontend Modularization (Weeks 1-3)

### Week 1: State Management Setup
- [ ] Install and configure Zustand for state management
- [ ] Create store structure for:
  - Auth store
  - Sample store
  - Workflow store
  - UI store (modals, notifications, etc.)
- [ ] Migrate existing state from components to stores

### Week 2: Component Decomposition
- [ ] Break down `nanopore-dashboard.tsx` into:
  - `DashboardLayout.tsx`
  - `DashboardHeader.tsx`
  - `SampleFilters.tsx`
  - `SampleList.tsx`
  - `SampleTable.tsx`
  - `BulkActions.tsx`
  - `WorkflowPanel.tsx`
- [ ] Extract custom hooks:
  - `useSamples.ts`
  - `useSampleOperations.ts`
  - `useWorkflow.ts`
  - `useBulkOperations.ts`

### Week 3: Feature Module Structure
- [ ] Create feature-based folder structure
- [ ] Move components to appropriate features
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for feature modules
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for all components

## Phase 2: Backend Service Optimization (Weeks 4-6)

### Week 4: Python Service Standardization
- [ ] Implement consistent service architecture:
  ```
  services/
  ├── sample-management/
  │   ├── app/
  │   │   ├── api/
  │   │   ├── core/
  │   │   ├── domain/
  │   │   ├── infrastructure/
  │   │   └── tests/
  ```
- [ ] Add dependency injection containers
- [ ] Implement repository pattern consistently
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

### Week 5: Event-Driven Architecture
- [ ] Set up Redis for pub/sub
- [ ] Implement event bus service
- [ ] Define event schemas:
  - SampleCreated
  - WorkflowStepCompleted
  - StatusChanged
  - AssignmentChanged
- [ ] Add event handlers in relevant services

### Week 6: API Gateway Enhancement
- [ ] Consolidate tRPC endpoints
- [ ] Add request validation middleware
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add API versioning
- [ ] Set up API documentation

## Phase 3: MCP Integration (Weeks 7-9)

### Week 7: MCP Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up MCP server framework
- [ ] Create Document Intelligence server:
  - PDF extraction tools
  - Form validation tools
  - Auto-fill capabilities
- [ ] Integrate with existing AI service

### Week 8: Domain Expert Server
- [ ] Implement validation tools
- [ ] Add flow cell recommendation logic
- [ ] Create QC analysis tools
- [ ] Add prediction capabilities

### Week 9: Workflow Automation
- [ ] Build workflow optimization tools
- [ ] Implement intelligent assignment
- [ ] Add completion time predictions
- [ ] Create performance analysis tools

## Phase 4: Testing & Quality (Weeks 10-11)

### Week 10: Test Coverage
- [ ] Add unit tests for all new modules (target: 80% coverage)
- [ ] Create integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Add E2E tests for critical workflows
- [ ] Set up continuous testing in CI/CD

### Week 11: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Add virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] Optimize database queries (add indexes, use joins)
- [ ] Implement caching strategy
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

## Phase 5: Deployment & Migration (Week 12)

### Week 12: Production Deployment
- [ ] Create migration scripts for existing data
- [ ] Update Docker configurations
- [ ] Update OpenShift manifests
- [ ] Perform staged rollout:
  1. Deploy to staging
  2. Run smoke tests
  3. Deploy to production (canary)
  4. Monitor and rollback if needed
  5. Full production deployment

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- Component size: No component > 300 lines
- Function complexity: Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- Test coverage: > 80%
- TypeScript coverage: 100%

### Performance
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- API response time: < 200ms (p95)
- Database query time: < 50ms (p95)
- Memory usage: < 512MB per service

### Developer Experience
- Build time: < 2 minutes
- Test execution: < 5 minutes
- Hot reload time: < 1 second
- Clear documentation for all modules

## Risk Mitigation

### Gradual Migration
- Keep old code functional during refactoring
- Use feature flags for new implementations
- Maintain backwards compatibility

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before refactoring
- Use snapshot testing for UI changes
- Perform load testing before deployment

### Rollback Plan
- Tag all stable versions
- Keep database migrations reversible
- Document rollback procedures
- Test rollback process in staging
