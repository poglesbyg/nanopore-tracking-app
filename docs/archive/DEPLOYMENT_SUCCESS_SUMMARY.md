# Deployment Success Summary

## Deployment Details
- **Date**: July 17, 2025
- **Build**: nanopore-tracking-app-9
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully Deployed
- **Pods**: 2/2 running (High Availability)
- **Application URL**: https://nanopore-tracking-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/nanopore

## Changes Deployed

### 1. UI Status Update Fixes
**File**: `src/components/nanopore/nanopore-dashboard.tsx`
- Fixed sample status updates not reflecting in UI immediately
- Added proper cache invalidation using `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`
- Standardized field names to use snake_case consistently (`assigned_to`, `library_prep_by`, etc.)
- Added comprehensive debugging logs for mutation tracking
- Added display of missing `library_prep_by` field

### 2. Form Validation Improvements
**File**: `src/components/nanopore/create-sample-modal.tsx`
- Enhanced validation to check for both undefined and empty string values
- Added HTML5 `required` attributes to form inputs
- Improved data transformation ensuring proper types sent to backend
- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging
- Pre-submission validation to catch issues before API calls

### 3. React Query Configuration Optimization
**File**: `src/components/providers/trpc-provider.tsx`
- Set `staleTime: 0` to always fetch fresh data
- Set `gcTime: 5 minutes` for optimal cache retention
- Enabled `refetchOnWindowFocus` and `refetchOnReconnect`

### 4. Database Connection Pool Optimizations
**File**: `src/lib/database/connection-pool.ts`
- Reduced minimum connections from 5 to 2
- Reduced maximum connections from 20 to 8
- Shortened idle timeout from 30s to 20s
- Enabled `allowExitOnIdle` for better memory management

## Testing the Deployed Changes

### Test Status Updates
1. Navigate to: https://nanopore-tracking-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/nanopore
2. Create or select a sample
3. Update the status (e.g., from "Received" to "Processing")
4. **Expected**: Status change reflects immediately without page refresh
5. **Expected**: Assignment and other field updates also reflect immediately

### Test Form Validation
1. Click "Create New Sample" button
2. Try submitting with empty required fields
3. **Expected**: Validation prevents submission and shows clear error messages
4. Fill in required fields and submit
5. **Expected**: Sample creates successfully and appears in the list immediately

### Test Real-time Updates
1. Open the application in two browser tabs
2. Update a sample in one tab
3. **Expected**: Changes appear in both tabs without manual refresh

## Performance Status

### Current Metrics
- **Memory Usage**: 93% heap (still high, but stable)
- **Database**: Healthy with optimized connection pool
- **Response Time**: Health check ~2-3ms
- **Uptime**: Stable with no restarts

### Memory Optimization Notes
- Application is running with `--expose-gc` flag disabled (security best practice)
- Connection pool optimizations are active
- Memory usage is high but stable (no memory leaks detected)
- Consider increasing memory limits if performance degrades

## Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
- ✅ Application responding on all routes
- ✅ Database connection healthy
- ✅ SSL/TLS working correctly
- ✅ Security headers properly configured

### Monitoring
- ✅ Prometheus metrics collection active
- ✅ Structured logging working
- ✅ Health endpoint responding
- ✅ Load balancing across 2 pods

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Have users test the UI improvements
2. **Monitor Performance**: Watch memory usage trends
3. **Gather Feedback**: Collect user feedback on the improved UI responsiveness
4. **Consider Memory Scaling**: If memory usage becomes problematic, increase pod memory limits

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered:
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
oc rollout undo deployment/nanopore-tracking-app

# Verify rollback
oc rollout status deployment/nanopore-tracking-app
```
