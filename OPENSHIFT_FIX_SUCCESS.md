# OpenShift Fix - SUCCESS! üéâ

## What Was Fixed

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed:
1. **Data Migration**: All 11 submissions migrated from `submissions` ‚Üí `nanopore_submissions` table
2. **Duplicate Handling**: Fixed duplicate submission names by adding unique suffixes
3. **Application Restart**: `nanopore-tracking-app` deployment restarted successfully
4. **Data Sync**: Both tables now have matching data

### The Fix That Worked:
```bash
./scripts/fix-openshift-duplicates.sh
```

This script:
- Handled the duplicate "Nanopore Sequencing Project - JL-147" submissions
- Added unique suffixes to duplicates (e.g., "...-JL-147-e57")
- Migrated all 11 records successfully
- Restarted the application automatically

## Current Status

### Database State:
| Table | Record Count | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `submissions` | 11 | ‚úÖ Original data preserved |
| `nanopore_submissions` | 11 | ‚úÖ Data migrated successfully |
| `nanopore_samples` | 0 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Empty - needs samples imported |

### Application:
- **URL**: https://nanopore-tracking-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu
- **Deployment**: `nanopore-tracking-app` (running)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Restarted and running

## What Still Needs To Be Done

### 1. Import Samples
The `nanopore_samples` table is empty. You need to either:
- Create samples manually through the UI
- Import samples from CSV/PDF files
- Use the bulk import scripts

### 2. Verify the Application
1. Visit: https://nanopore-tracking-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu
2. Check that submissions are visible
3. Try creating a sample through the UI

## Scripts Created

| Script | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `fix-openshift-duplicates.sh` | Handles duplicate names and migrates data | ‚úÖ SUCCESS |
| `check-openshift-deployments.sh` | Lists deployments and services | ‚úÖ Working |
| `find-and-import-samples.sh` | Searches for sample data | ‚úÖ Working (no samples found) |
| `diagnose-openshift-db.sh` | Database diagnostic tool | ‚úÖ Working |

## Key Learnings

1. **Table Structure**: OpenShift has `nanopore_submissions` table with different columns than local
2. **Unique Constraints**: `submission_number` must be unique
3. **No Samples**: The database had submissions but no actual sample data
4. **Deployment Name**: The actual deployment is `nanopore-tracking-app`, not `nanopore-frontend`

## Next Steps

### To Import Samples:
If you have sample data in CSV or PDF files:
```bash
# Check the existing import scripts
ls scripts/import*.sh

# Run an appropriate import script
./scripts/import-htsf-complete.sh  # or another import script
```

### To Create Test Samples:
You can create samples manually through the application UI:
1. Go to the application
2. Select a submission
3. Add samples to it

### To Monitor:
```bash
# Check pod status
oc get pods | grep nanopore

# Check logs if needed
oc logs deployment/nanopore-tracking-app

# Check database
oc exec postgresql-6d6d97fd7-qr7zt -- psql -U postgres -d nanopore_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nanopore_samples;"
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **The main issue is FIXED** - submissions are now in the correct table and the application has been restarted. The data should now be visible in your OpenShift deployment.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Samples still need to be imported** - the `nanopore_samples` table is empty, so you won't see any samples until they're created or imported.

The application should now be working at: https://nanopore-tracking-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu
