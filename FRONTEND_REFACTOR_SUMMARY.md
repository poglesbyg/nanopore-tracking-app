# Frontend Refactor Summary - PDF Submission Workflow

## Overview
We've created a clean, focused frontend for PDF submission that eliminates repetition and focuses solely on the PDF upload and submission workflow.

## New Structure

### Pages
- `/submit-pdf` - Clean PDF submission page
- `/` - Updated home page with clear navigation

### Components

#### Main Workflow Component
- `pdf-submission-app.tsx` - Orchestrates the entire submission workflow with three clear steps:
  1. Upload PDF
  2. Review & Submit
  3. Success

#### Focused Components
1. **PdfUploader** (`pdf-uploader.tsx`)
   - Single responsibility: Handle PDF file upload
   - Clean drag-and-drop interface
   - Progress indication during processing
   - Error handling

2. **SubmissionForm** (`submission-form.tsx`)
   - Single responsibility: Review and edit extracted data
   - Shows confidence level and extraction method
   - Allows corrections before submission
   - Validates required fields

3. **SubmissionSuccess** (`submission-success.tsx`)
   - Single responsibility: Confirm successful submission
   - Provides submission ID
   - Offers receipt download
   - Clear next steps

### Types
- `submission.ts` - Clean TypeScript interfaces for:
  - ExtractedData
  - SubmissionData
  - SampleData
  - ProcessingResult

## Key Improvements

1. **No Repetition**: Each component has a single, clear purpose
2. **Clean Workflow**: Linear progression through upload → review → success
3. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error states and user feedback
5. **Responsive Design**: Works well on all screen sizes

## PDF Processing Flow

1. User uploads PDF via drag-and-drop
2. Frontend sends PDF to `/api/submission/process-pdf`
3. Backend extracts data using pattern matching and optional AI enhancement
4. Extracted data is displayed for review
5. User can edit any fields before submission
6. Submission creates a new sample in the database
7. Success page confirms submission with ID

## Backend Integration

The frontend integrates with the Python submission service through:
- `submissionServiceClient` - Handles PDF upload and processing
- API Gateway routes - `/api/submission/*`
- TRPC for database operations - Creates samples after review

## Next Steps

To extend this clean architecture:
1. Add bulk PDF upload support
2. Add sample tracking after submission
3. Add email notifications
4. Add admin review workflow
5. Add submission history view
