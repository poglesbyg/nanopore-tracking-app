# data-flow-architecture

Core Data Flow Components:

## Sample Submission Pipeline
- Hierarchical flow through stages: submitted → prep → sequencing → analysis → completed
- Real-time status updates propagated through event bus
- PDF form data extracted via specialized pattern matching
- Sample metadata validated against domain rules
- Automatic state transitions based on workflow progress

## Event-Driven Processing
- SagaOrchestrator manages distributed transactions with compensation
- AI events handle document processing with multiple methods (LLM, pattern, hybrid, RAG)
- Sample events track laboratory workflow states
- Distributed tracing for cross-service correlation

## Service Communication
- Service mesh handles inter-service communication
- Circuit breaker patterns protect downstream services
- Load balancing optimizes request distribution
- Rate limiting enforces quotas

## Data Export Transformations 
- Sample data exports with configurable formats
- Laboratory results transformed for reporting
- Audit trail generation for compliance
- Performance metrics collection and aggregation

## Critical Data Flows:
1. PDF Sample Submission:
```
Submit PDF → Extract Data → Validate → Create Sample → Update Status
```

2. Sample Processing:
```
Update Stage → Validate Rules → Record Changes → Notify Status → Update UI
```

3. Export Generation:
```
Request Export → Gather Data → Transform Format → Generate File → Deliver
```
