# data-flow-architecture

Core Data Flow Components:

1. Sample Submission Pipeline
- PDF/CSV submissions flow through memory-optimized submission service
- Multi-stage extraction process:
  1. Pattern matching for structured fields 
  2. AI enhancement for unstructured content
  3. RAG system for validation/enrichment
- Chunked processing with configurable batch sizes (100 rows CSV, page-by-page PDF)
- Integration with sample creation workflow via TRPC endpoints

2. Real-Time Status Updates
- Event-driven status propagation through message bus
- Saga pattern for distributed sample processing:
  - Submission → Prep → Sequencing → Analysis → Completion
- Circuit breaker implementation for service health management
- Optimistic locking for concurrent status updates

3. PDF Processing Pipeline  
- Domain-specific extraction rules for HTSF quote forms
- Tiered confidence scoring system:
  - Pattern matches: 0.95
  - Context matches: 0.75 
  - Fuzzy matches: 0.65
- Memory-optimized processing (50-100MB per PDF)
- Fallback processing chain for extraction failures

4. Export Transformations
- Specialized formatting for lab workflows
- Multi-format support: CSV, JSON
- Custom field mapping for external systems
- Configurable retention policies for exported data

Critical Data Flows:

/services/submission-service/
- Initial sample data ingestion
- Validation and enrichment
- Memory-optimized processing

/services/ai-processing/
- PDF text extraction
- Confidence scoring
- RAG enhancement

/services/sample-management/
- Status workflow management
- Assignment tracking
- Processing coordination

/services/audit/
- Activity logging
- Compliance tracking
- Chain of custody maintenance

The architecture emphasizes reliable sample processing with multiple validation stages while maintaining strict memory constraints and providing comprehensive audit trails.
