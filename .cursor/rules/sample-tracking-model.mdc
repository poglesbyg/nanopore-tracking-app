# sample-tracking-model

## Sample Data Model
```typescript
interface NanoporeSample {
  id: string
  status: 'submitted' | 'prep' | 'sequencing' | 'analysis' | 'completed' | 'archived'
  priority: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high' | 'urgent'
  metadata: {
    concentration: number
    volume: number 
    a260_280_ratio: number
    flow_cell_type: string
    chart_field: string
  }
  timestamps: {
    submitted: Date
    prep_start?: Date
    sequencing_start?: Date
    analysis_start?: Date
    completed?: Date
    archived?: Date
  }
}
```

## Status Progression Logic
- Enforces sequential workflow: submitted → prep → sequencing → analysis → completed → archived
- Each transition records timestamp automatically
- Prep requires valid concentration and volume
- Sequencing requires valid a260_280_ratio
- Analysis requires successful sequencing completion
- Archival only allowed after completion

## Priority System
- Four priority levels with specific SLA targets:
  - urgent: 24 hours
  - high: 48 hours
  - normal: 5 business days
  - low: 10 business days
- Priority upgrades allowed but require approval
- Priority affects resource allocation in processing pipeline

## Processing Workflow Integration
- Interfaces with laboratory equipment for automated status updates
- Validates sample requirements before each stage transition
- Tracks sample location and chain of custody
- Manages flow cell assignments and sequencing runs
- Records quality control metrics at each stage

Importance Score: 90
