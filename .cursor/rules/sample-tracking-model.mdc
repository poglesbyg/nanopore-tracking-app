# sample-tracking-model

Core Sample Data Model:

1. Sample Status Workflow
- Sequential status progression:
  ```
  submitted → assigned → in_progress → completed
       ↓         ↓           ↓           ↓
    cancelled  cancelled  cancelled    (end)
       ↓           ↓           ↓
    failed → in_progress (retry)
  ```
- Each transition requires validation and triggers status-specific hooks
- Status changes emit domain events for audit tracking

2. Priority Classification System
- 5-level priority scale (1-5) with validation
- Priority affects queue position and processing order
- Auto-adjustment based on wait time thresholds
- Emergency override capability for urgent samples

3. Sample Metadata Requirements
- Required fields:
  - Sample name (unique within system)
  - Submitter details
  - Flow cell type (FLO-MIN106 through FLO-MIN300)
  - Concentration metrics
  - Volume measurements
  - Chart field for billing
- Optional fields:
  - Project association
  - Notes/comments
  - Custom metadata (1000 char limit)

4. Sample Repository Integration
- Status-based query optimization
- Priority-driven queue management
- Soft delete implementation ("deleted" status)
- Processing history with audit trails

Key Business Rules:
- Status transitions must follow defined workflow
- Chart field must match pattern: (HTSF|NANO|SEQ)-\d{3}
- Priority changes trigger queue reordering
- Metadata validation prohibits sensitive info
- Sample names must be unique system-wide

Notable Domain Logic:
- Flow cell compatibility validation
- Status-based permission checks
- Multi-step workflow progression
- Priority-based resource allocation
