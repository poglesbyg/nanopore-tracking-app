Core 8-Step Nanopore Sample Processing Workflow:

1. Sample QC (1h)
- Initial quality control validation 
- Concentration verification (0.1-1000 ng/μL)
- Volume validation (0.1-1000 μL)
- Required fields: sample name, submitter info, chart field

2. Library Preparation (4h)
- DNA/RNA library construction
- Kit compatibility validation
- Barcoding requirements check
- Records library prep specialist assignment

3. Library QC (1h)
- Validates library quality metrics
- Fragment size analysis
- Concentration re-verification
- Go/no-go quality gate

4. Sequencing Setup (1h)
- Flow cell preparation 
- Chemistry validation (R9.4.1, R10.4.1)
- Device type matching (PromethION/MinION)
- Run parameters configuration

5. Sequencing Run (48h)
- Active sequencing monitoring
- Real-time quality metrics
- Run progress tracking
- Error state detection

6. Basecalling (2h)
- Raw signal conversion
- Model selection logic
- Quality score calculation
- Read length distribution analysis

7. Quality Assessment (1h)
- Read quality verification
- Coverage calculation
- Error rate analysis 
- Pass/fail determination

8. Data Delivery (1h)
- Results packaging
- Delivery method selection
- Archive requirements check
- Completion notification

Workflow State Transitions:
- Sequential progression through all 8 stages
- Each stage requires completion before advancement
- Failed stages trigger rework or sample rejection
- Priority levels affect queue position

Key Validation Rules:
- Chart field format: (HTSF|NANO|SEQ)-\d{3}
- Concentration ranges by type:
  - DNA: 0.1-1000 ng/μL
  - RNA: 0.1-500 ng/μL
  - Protein: 0.5-2000 μg/mL
- Volume minimum: 0.1 μL
- Required fields enforced at each stage

Priority Classifications:
- urgent: Skip queue, immediate processing
- high: Next in queue
- normal: Standard processing
- low: Process when resources available

Implementation Paths:
- src/services/sample-management/workflow.ts
- src/lib/nanopore/processing-steps.ts
- src/repositories/WorkflowStateManager.ts
