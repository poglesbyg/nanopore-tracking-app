# nanopore-workflow-model

The nanopore sequencing workflow implements an 8-stage model for processing samples:

1. Sample QC
- Initial quality control validation
- Records concentration, purity ratios
- Validates sample meets minimum requirements
- Status transitions: submitted → qc_started → qc_complete/qc_failed

2. Library Preparation 
- Tracks library prep kit and chemistry
- Records adaptor ligation metrics
- Validates library concentration
- Status: qc_complete → prep_started → prep_complete/prep_failed

3. Library QC
- Secondary QC after library prep
- Validates library size distribution
- Checks final concentration
- Status: prep_complete → lib_qc_started → lib_qc_complete/lib_qc_failed

4. Sequencing Setup
- Flow cell QC and priming
- Platform configuration 
- Run parameters setup
- Status: lib_qc_complete → seq_setup_started → seq_setup_complete

5. Sequencing Run
- Active sequencing monitoring
- Yield tracking
- Run metrics collection
- Status: seq_setup_complete → sequencing_started → sequencing_complete

6. Basecalling
- Raw signal processing
- Base sequence generation
- Quality scoring
- Status: sequencing_complete → basecalling_started → basecalling_complete

7. Quality Assessment
- Read quality analysis 
- Coverage calculation
- Error rate determination
- Status: basecalling_complete → qc_analysis_started → qc_analysis_complete

8. Data Delivery
- Results packaging
- Data transfer
- Delivery confirmation
- Status: qc_analysis_complete → delivery_started → complete

- src/types/nanopore-submission.ts

Importance Score: 90

Key workflow rules:
- Sequential stage progression only
- Each stage requires previous stage completion
- Failed states block progression
- Stage transitions log timestamp and operator
- Quality gates between major stages
- Automated state transitions based on process signals
