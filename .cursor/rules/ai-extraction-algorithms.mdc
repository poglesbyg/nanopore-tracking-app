# ai-extraction-algorithms

## PDF Pattern Matching Engine
- Specialized pattern matching for nanopore sequencing form fields
- Multi-tier matching strategy with confidence scoring:
  - Primary patterns (0.95 confidence) for exact field matches
  - Secondary patterns (0.85 confidence) for variations 
  - Contextual patterns (0.75 confidence) for related content
  - Fuzzy patterns (0.65 confidence) for potential matches
- Domain-specific confidence boosting based on scientific terminology
- Field-specific validation rules for nanopore sequencing data

Importance Score: 85

## Scientific Document Processing Pipeline
- Event-driven AI processing workflow with multiple methods:
  - LLM processing for unstructured content
  - Pattern matching for standardized forms
  - Hybrid approach combining both methods
  - RAG enhancement with domain knowledge
- Confidence scoring and validation of extracted data
- Model performance degradation tracking
- Domain-specific processing steps:
  - Scientific metadata extraction
  - Pattern matching for lab data
  - LLM processing for scientific content
  - RAG enhancement with domain knowledge

Importance Score: 90

## Progress Tracking
- Specialized workflow tracking for document processing
- Step-specific duration estimates for sequencing workflows
- Weighted progress calculation based on scientific processing complexity

Importance Score: 75
