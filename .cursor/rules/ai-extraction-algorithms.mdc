Core AI Extraction Components:

1. PDF Form Processing Pipeline
- Primary extraction using domain-specific LLM prompt patterns
- Fallback processing using regex pattern matching
- RAG enhancement using domain knowledge base
- Custom confidence scoring algorithm

2. Field Processing Strategies:
```typescript
// Field confidence scoring weights
const confidenceWeights = {
  llm_extraction: 0.6,
  pattern_match: 0.3, 
  rag_enhancement: 0.1
}

// Processing methods
type ExtractionMethod = 'llm' | 'pattern' | 'hybrid' | 'rag'
```

3. Confidence Scoring System:
- Field-level confidence based on extraction method
- Aggregate confidence across multiple methods
- Threshold-based acceptance (>0.7 required)
- Confidence boosting through RAG validation

4. Field Validation Rules:
- Sample concentration format: /^\d+(\.\d+)?\s*(ng\/ul|ng\/ml|ug\/ml)$/i
- Volume measurements: /^\d+(\.\d+)?\s*(ul|ml)$/i
- Chart field format: /(HTSF|NANO|SEQ)-\d{3}/
- Flow cell types: /^(FLO-MIN106|FLO-MIN107|FLO-MIN110|FLO-MIN111|FLO-MIN114)$/

5. RAG Enhancement Pipeline:
- Domain-specific knowledge base for nanopore protocols
- Context-aware answer generation for form field validation
- Semantic matching for scientific terminology
- Confidence adjustment based on knowledge base matches
