4. ‚úÖ Implement workflow notes functionality - Enhanced notes with @mentions and templates
5. ‚úÖ Add delete functionality to Edit Modal - Delete button with confirmation dialog
6. ‚úÖ Add export button to View Modal - CSV and JSON export options

## Final Status Summary

### ‚ùå Remaining Items (Minor):
1. **Config Panel**: Reset to defaults, Import/Export config functionality
2. **Shutdown Panel**: Force shutdown, Cancel shutdown options  
3. **Audit Panel**: Advanced filtering options
4. **Runtime Testing**: Full end-to-end testing of admin panels

### üìù Next Steps (Optional Enhancements):
1. Add config import/export functionality to Config Panel
2. Implement force/cancel shutdown options in Shutdown Panel
3. Add advanced filtering options to Audit Panel  
4. Perform comprehensive runtime testing of admin panels
5. Consider additional performance optimizations based on usage patterns
