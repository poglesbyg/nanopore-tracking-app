## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd services/mcp-servers/sample-management
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` file with database connection details:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=nanopore_db
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=postgres
   ```

3. **Build the Server**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run the Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or for development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Integration with Claude Desktop

To use this MCP server with Claude Desktop, add it to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sample-management": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/services/mcp-servers/sample-management/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DB_HOST": "localhost",
        "DB_PORT": "5432",
        "DB_NAME": "nanopore_db",
        "DB_USER": "postgres",
        "DB_PASSWORD": "postgres"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Analyzing Workflow Performance
```
Please analyze our workflow performance for the last 30 days and identify any bottlenecks.
```

### Optimizing Sample Schedule
```
Generate an optimized schedule for our pending samples, prioritizing urgent samples with a weight of 5.
```

### Assignment Recommendations
```
Recommend assignments for all unassigned DNA samples, considering operator skills and current workload.
```

### Workload Balance Analysis
```
Analyze the current workload balance across our team and suggest improvements.
```

## Architecture

The MCP server is built with:

- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with full IntelliSense support
- **Kysely**: Type-safe SQL query builder for database operations
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation for API parameters
- **Date-fns**: Robust date manipulation and calculations

### Key Components

- **WorkflowAnalyzer**: Analyzes performance metrics and identifies bottlenecks
- **AssignmentOptimizer**: Optimizes sample-to-operator assignments
- **DatabaseConnection**: Manages database connectivity and connection pooling
- **Types**: Comprehensive type definitions for all data structures

## Development

### Adding New Tools

1. Define the tool schema in the `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler
2. Add the tool handler in the `CallToolRequestSchema` switch statement
3. Implement the tool logic in the appropriate analyzer class
4. Add comprehensive error handling and validation

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```
