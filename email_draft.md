Subject: OpenShift Resource Request - Production Deployment of Nanopore Tracking Application

Dear OpenShift Platform Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to request the necessary OpenShift resources and permissions to deploy our nanopore tracking application to production.

Current Application Status
Our nanopore tracking application has been successfully developed and tested, with all container builds completing successfully. The application is now ready for production deployment on OpenShift.

Resource Requirements

1. Namespace Management
Request: A dedicated production namespace for our nanopore tracking application
Alternative: Namespace creation permissions for our development team
Justification: Required for proper isolation and management of our microservices architecture

2. Storage Resources
Request: Storage quota allocation of 5-10Gi for production workloads
Usage: 
  - PDF processing and temporary file storage (2-3Gi)
  - Sample data persistence and backups (2-3Gi)
  - Application logs and monitoring data (1-2Gi)
  - Container image storage (2Gi)

3. Security Context Constraints
Request: Appropriate SCCs for running Node.js and Python containers
Specific needs: 
  - Python-based microservices (AI processing, file storage, sample management)
  - Node.js frontend service (Astro/React application)
  - File system access for PDF processing workflows

4. Network Policies and Routes
Request: External route creation permissions
Justification: Web-based application requiring external access for end users

Application Architecture Overview
Our production-ready application consists of:
- Frontend Service: Astro/React application with TypeScript (successfully building)
- API Gateway: Central routing and load balancing
- Microservices: 
  - AI Processing Service (Python-based PDF extraction)
  - Sample Management Service (Node.js/TypeScript)
  - Authentication Service (secure user management)
  - File Storage Service (PDF and document handling)
  - Audit Service (compliance and tracking)

Deployment Readiness
- All container builds are successful
- Multi-stage Docker builds optimized for production
- OpenShift deployment manifests prepared
- Health checks and monitoring endpoints implemented
- Security configurations in place

Timeline
Target Production Date: Within the next 2 weeks
Reason: We have completed development and testing phases, and stakeholders are expecting the production rollout to proceed as scheduled.

Next Steps
Could you please provide:
1. Confirmation of resource availability and any limitations
2. The formal process for requesting these resources
3. Any required documentation or approval forms
4. Estimated timeline for resource provisioning
5. Contact information for technical coordination during deployment

Additional Information
I'm happy to provide:
- Detailed resource utilization estimates
- Application architecture diagrams
- Security compliance documentation
- Deployment manifests for review

Thank you for your support in helping us bring this scientific data management solution to production. I'm available for a meeting or call to discuss these requirements in more detail.

Best regards,
